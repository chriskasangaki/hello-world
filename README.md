# hello-world
My first repository on git-hub
This is Chris R. Kasangaki. I am learning programming on Git-hub but my specific interest is in creating android apps, which I believ are the future. First, I would like to learn how to create an app and then I will build a Uganda app which should contain anything and everything about uganda. It is a massive project but I believe it is very necessary.
